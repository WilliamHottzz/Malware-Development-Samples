- Appears to be dynamically importing from user32 and kernel32.
- Appears to have utf-16 encoded strings along with other types of obfuscation.
- Has custom sleep function, probably to evade anti viruses that get triggered on rapid winapi calls.
- Has custom methods of detecting debuggers, appears to use asm blocks to detect debug triggers and one method that's identical to what IsDebuggerPresent() does.
